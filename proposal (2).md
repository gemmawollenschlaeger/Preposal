## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Depending on the animal I chose to use! and the name I give it. Maybe Pet Rosen? 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Virtual pet that goes through different emotions and feelings - hunger, thrist, tired, happy, sad etc. and as the user you can then click on things that will fix that emotion. Such as some sort of food to make the hunger bar fill up etc. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will be using python. The animal will be describing a mood from their emotions. It will have objects to click on that will be able to change the mood of the pet. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Having the drawings pop up for what mood is being randomly chosen for that time. 
Having the mood change every couple seconds - in reality it would be throughout the day but that isn't applicable for this kind of project. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

It being a smooth process. From mood to mood. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Being able to have bars that describe the mood and those change with the emotions. 
Having lots of emotions and feelings and more than one answers to it, so like food can increase both hunger and happiness. But burnt food increase hunger but increase sadness.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Need to draw the moods
