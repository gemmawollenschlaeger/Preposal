# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Game Idea - 
Crossy Roads - I draw the characters and the landscape 
Battle Ship - vs random player 

Another idea Combinding 'easier' games into one 
    Potentially having backward rules - game based on time but actually want to take the longest 
    Creating an interface with multiple games on it 


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Just myself 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Would be creating an interface with multiple games on it worth of a final project? Even if the games are notes as 'easier' games.
